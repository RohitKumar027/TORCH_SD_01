# TORCH_SD_01
In this Task, I have created a CPP and a Python program that takes the temperature as input by the user in the desired unit (Kelvin or Celcius or Fahrenheit) and converts them to values of other units.
I have used Google Colab for Python code so I have created simple interactive widgets using the ipywidgets library. While it won't provide the same GUI experience as Tkinter, it allows for creating basic interactive elements within the Colab environment.
